## Setup

In this part, run all the commands in root folder of project.

### Install dependencies

```
yarn
```

### Database configuration & seed

Next, you need some dummy data to test API. Ensure you have a postgree database started before.
The Postgree configuration can be set in .env file, you will see these variables :

```javascript
PG_HOST=localhost
PG_PORT=5432
PG_USER=parkuser
PG_PASSWORD=password
PG_DB_NAME=parkmanager
```

Once it's done, you need to construct the database 

```
node ace migration:run
```

If anything goes wrong during this step, type 
```node ace migration:rollback``` to clean the database and retry

Finally, fill it with some dummy data

```
node ace db:seed
```

And it's done ! ðŸŽ‰
